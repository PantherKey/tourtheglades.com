Everglades City & Chokoloskee Island are a birders paradise!  We are located in the "3 Corners" section of the Everglades where Everglades National Park, Fakahatcheee Strand State Preserve and Big Cypress National Preserve all meet.
If you are a serious birder and looking to build your list or searching for a specific "Life Bird" this is the tour for you.
My buddy Drew is a year round resident and expert birder who can deliver the hard to find species.
Drew has worked for 7 years doing bird and wildlife rehabilitation and is currently assisting the Conservancy of SW Florida on their various avian projects.
He can take you deep in the wilderness and even around town to locate your "Target Species".
Pileated  Woodpecker, Roseate Spoonbill, Mangrove Cuckoo, Harrier Hawk and even the Painted Bunting have all been discovered here.
We have found that the best way to find these birds is on a walking tour or by motorboat.
Most tours are approximately 3 hours but can be customized for your Target Species.
All tours are Private....fresh fruit, water and all your necessities are provided (even binoculars).
Email or give us a call with the birds you are looking for and we can decide the best way to spot them.
