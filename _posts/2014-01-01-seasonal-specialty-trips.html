Our guides monitor wildlife movement throughout the year and can bring you to the right place at the right time to witness some very unique animal behaviors.
Courtship, mating, nesting and hunting for example can all be observed year round.    
We have also developed a few specialty tours for our guests that we offer every once and a while.
These tours change throughout the season so check back often.

*Please remember that the Everglades is a vast area and the wildlife can come and go as it pleases.  It's very different from a zoo where you pay to see each animal in an exhibit. 
During our tours we set out in search of the wildlife much like you would on a safari. We have superb guides that live here year round and are very much in tune with the animal's behavior and seasonal movements. 
Our past guests have seen all of the Big 5 over the past 9 years and have written about it in their reviews. However, we can not guarantee that you will have the exact same experience because every tour is different.
