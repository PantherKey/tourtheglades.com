<p>
Have you ever dreamed of becoming a certified "Master Naturalist" ? It's not as difficult as you may think.
If you have a few extra days and $200 you can receive your certificate from the prestigious University of Florida.
Classes are offered throughout the year and are both fun and educational.
Many of our seasonal residents and extended vacationers take the course to better familiarize themselves with the area's flora and fauna.
This is more of a classroom / textbook approach that also includes a field trip!  Anyone age 18 and up is welcome to attend.
