Nature and the evvironment have been my passion since I was a child and I bring that with me on every adventure.   
It was my early obsession with reptiles & amphibians that led me into the Florida wilderness.
I first began catching snakes, lizards and turtles in the 3rd grade and bringing them to school for show & tell.
I would constantly try to convince my friends to come with me to look for animals and explore the wilderness....now they call that "Eco-Tourism".
Florida history is also one of my passions and that seeps into my tours as well.
I'm on the board of directors at the Everglades Society for Historic Preservation and continuously study the lives and culture of the Florida natives, early settlers and pioneers.
I do not fancy myself as a teacher and will never address you like I'm your camp counselor. I don't try to instill fear in my guests....I choose to empower them with knowledge instead.
I've spent 30+ years exploring the Florida wilderness and I pass that knowledge & confidence on to my guests.

I only offer private tours because I know from experience that the less noise you make the more wildlife you’ll encounter. 
This also allows you to move along at your own pace and enhances your overall experience.
We don't just get a snapshot of a bird as we pass it by. We discover animals in their natural habitat and stop to observe their behaviors.
Hunting, grooming, courtship, fighting, etc.  This is much more enriching and allows our guests to get closer to nature making a deeper connection. 
When you set out in a van with a mixed group of people it’s just not the same as going with your own personal guide. Following behind a group is also counterproductive when trying to spot wildlife.
We do all our private tours in the hard to reach areas that are less traveled by tourists. I find my guests enjoy the quiet and isolation of the Everglades as well.
The Everglades is not the horrifying, scary place that some will have you believe.  It's actually a beautifull, delicate environment that you must "get into" in order to truly appreciate.
If anyone attempts to convince you otherwise it's only because they do not yet understand this ecosystem and it's wildlife.

When choosing a guide (no mater where you’re visiting) you’ll want to go with a Native.
Someone born and raised in the area with a true natural passion for what they’re doing will make the difference in your trip.
I'm here boating, hiking and camping in the Everglades & 10,000 Islands year round.  When I'm not taking guests out on tours I'm outdoors with my children and friends.
My job is a lifestyle...not a 1-800 business plan. I feel that's what makes my tours different from the rest.
My guests experience that first hand and write about it in their Tripadvisor reviews.  I end up becoming friends with many of my guests and they'll show up from time to time with other friends & family.
After your tour hopefully I'll become your go-to guy in the Everglades!
