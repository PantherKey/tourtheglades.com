The Everglades also consists of the the many mangrove and barrier islands along Florida's Southwest coast.
This area is known as The 10,000 Islands.
Kayaks are great for exploring the calm waters of the backcountry but the absolute best way to explore this vast wilderness is by motorboat.
The 10,000 Islands stretch from Marco Island to Florida Bay and include Everglades National Park, Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve and The 10,000 Islands National Wildlife Refuge.
In addition to the extraordinary wildlife this area has been inhabited by humans for over 3,000 years! The ancient Calusa Indians, Pirates, Spanish Explores, Florida Pioneers and modern day Hermits have all left their mark here.

You'll begin your adventure by searching for one of our most sought after residents, the Florida Manatee.
These gentle giants are here searching for vegetation to eat, fresh drinking water and warm temperatures.
Curious Dolphins are also frequent visitors and sometimes even jump and play in the wake of the boat.
Be on the look out for the American Bald Eagle, Osprey, Roseate Spoon Bill and a variety of wading birds as well.

Along the way you'll stop and pay a visit to one of the islands for a little beach combing and exploring as well.
The beaches and shore line are teaming with life here on the barrier islands. Preserved and undisturbed you'll swear you're the first one to ever set foot here.
