Have you ever dreamed of becoming a certified "Master Naturalist" ? It's not as difficult as you may think.
With a little extra time and determination you can receive your Florida Master Naturalist certificate from the University of Florida while visiting the Naples area.
Classes are offered throughout the year and are fun and educational.
Many of our seasonal residents and extended vacationers take the course to better familiarize themselves with the area's flora and fauna.
This is more of a classroom approach but each module also includes a field trip.  The course  does not provide university credit toward a degree-seeking program...but is more of an adult education program.
The course consists of Three Modules 1 - Freshwater Systems  2 - Coastal Systems  3 - Upland Systems.  Students must complete ALL THREE MODULES in order to receive their Master Naturalist accreditation.

</p>
Upon completion you'll receive an official plaque, patch & lapel pin!  Anyone age 18 and up is welcome to attend. Follow the link below for a class schedule and more details.
