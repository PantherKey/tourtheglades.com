    <h2 class="title"><strong>Welcome to The Everglades!</strong> </h2>

    <!--COPY-->
    <p>
    Thank you for choosing Tour The Glades! I'm Tod and I'll be your guide & host during your visit. 
    I have <strong>ONE</strong> job, providing Private Guided Tours in the Everglades and 10,000 Islands.
    I'm a Florida Native and live here in the Everglades year round.
    I have fine tuned my tours over the years and supply everything youâ€™ll need during your trip which makes planning stress free.
    We supply insect repellent (if needed), sunscreen, cold bottled water and fresh seasonal fruit for every trip.
    We also provide professional grade dry boxes to keep your camera and other personal belongings safe.  
    I've built the company's reputation by focusing on the Quality of our tours not the Quantity of guests.
    </p>
    
    I focus primarily on the Kayak, Hiking and Camping trips.  My buddy Captain Kent does the Motorboat tours
    Kent is a legend in these parts of The Glades.  His family were among the very first settlers here and made their homes among the 
    10,000 islands atop the ancient Calusa Indian mounds in the early 1800's (before Florida was a state).
    Kent was born and raised here on Chokoloskee Island and he'll be quick to tell you he's 10th generation.....
    I haven't been able to work out the math on that but it sounds about right.
    One thing for sure he's a genuine Everglades Islander through & through. 
    He's a combination of Andy Griffith, John Wayne & Bert Reynolds all wrapped up in one.  
    He's also a Master Captain, an expert fishermen and one heck of a story teller. 
    He knows every little bit of deep water in the backcountry which allows him to navigate through the islands like a dolphin.
    Back in the old days Kent and his family hunted some of the same animals he brings guests to see and interact with.  
    He's sort of an outlaw turned conservationist I guess. 
    You'll see for yourself how in tune he is with the behavior of the wildlife and how he's able to anticipate their every move.
    Captain Kent is just old enough to remember the old ways and still young enough to witness the change. 
    Be aware he has his own names for some of the islands and waterways in the area.
    He'll tell you he uses the "original names" that his family gave the islands....not the names the government came up with later.
    Kent is definitely one of a kind and will no doubt be the main character in your Everglades stories back home.
    </p>
    
    We can only do one (sometimes two) trips per day which makes each one special.
    Our guests tend to be travel & tour connoisseurs that have done their research. 
    They've experienced the "cookie cutter" tours elsewhere and recognize the benefits of my approach.
    If you end up running late for the start of your trip, no problem....we're not concerned with anyone else but you.
    Let me know if you have any special requests like birthdays, anniversary's, etc and we'll plan something unique. 
    We can offer this personal service to our guests because you are the only client and receive 100% of our attention.
    The <strong>Private Tour / Native Guide</strong> philosophy allows my guests to experience the Everglades in a very unique and intimate way.
    Our tours create lifelong memories.  Take a look at what we offer and decide what works best for you. 
     Whether you're searching for Alligator, Manatee, Panther, Rare Birds or just a relaxing day in Nature....we can deliver.
    Start times are flexible although morning and late afternoons are best for wildlife viewing.
    If you have any questions just send me an email or call and together we can come up with a plan.
    </p>
