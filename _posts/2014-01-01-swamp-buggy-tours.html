Swamp Buggies have been a part of the Gladesmen culture here in the Everglades for many years.
You can experience this Everglades tradition with a local guide year round.
Our SWAMP BUGGY Partner can take you deep into the Big Cypress National Preserve in search of Alligators, Black Bear and even Florida Panther!
You'll be seated high above the swamp which makes for great photography opportunities and move along at a slow pace through the great cypress forest to see places very few people experience.
The swamp buggies are semi-private and you can even get out and explore with your guide if you desire.
Intimate evening Campfire tours are also available....complete with toasted marshmallows!
