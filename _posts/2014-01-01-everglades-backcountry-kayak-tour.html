See parts of this vast wilderness that are only accessible by kayak.
Glide through the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades at your own pace as you explore the mangrove tunnels, grass prairies, and the hardwood hammocks of the backcountry.
Have your camera ready because alligators, osprey, otter, bald eagles and a variety of wading birds call this area home.
It’s a calm, leisurely paddle that’s great for first timers and experienced paddlers alike.
Early morning and just before sunset are the best times to go.
However, all tours are Private so we can be flexible and start at a time that’s most convenient for you.
A hat and sunglasses are a good idea but not mandatory.
We supply cold bottled water, fresh fruit, sunscreen, dry containers to protect your belongings and if needed…head lamps, rain ponchos &amp; bug spray all provided  complimentary.
We tell our guests to plan on a 4 hour commitment with about 3.5 on the water.
And yes we can certainly stop for a bathroom break if nature should call.
Our Ascend & Old Town kayaks are strong, sturdy and very comfortable. You can go in a single or a tandem.....whatever you prefer
