I will only do Private Tours because I know from experience that the less noise you make the more wildlife you’ll encounter.
This also allows you to move along more quietly, at your own pace and enhances your overall experience.
When you set out with a mixed group of people it’s just not the same as going with your own personal guide.
My guests are travel & tour connoisseurs.
They have have done the group tours in the past, researched the available tours here and realize my approach is best.
The <strong>Private Tour / Native Guide</strong> approach allows my guests to experience the Everglades in a very unique and intimate way.
I focus on the Quality of my tours not the Quantity.
I will never do group or "small group" tours because I know it only dilutes my guest's experience.
This is my passion....a lifestyle...not a 1-800 sausage factory business plan.
I didn't visit here on vacation once and decide it would be fun to come back during season to do tours.
I do not fancy myself as a teacher and will never address you like I'm your camp counselor.
We will discover the Everglades as friends.
When choosing a guide (no mater where you’re visiting) you’ll want to go with a Native.
Someone born and raised in the area with a true passion for what they’re doing will make the difference in your trip.
I'm here kayaking, hiking and camping in the Everglades & 10,000 Islands year round.
When I'm not taking guests out on tours I'm outdoors with my children and friends.
I can honestly say there is no guide in this area that's out exploring the Everglades more then I....that's a fact!

You can drive your car to our starting point so after we're done you're not forced to drive 14 miles in the other direction to drop off others in the group.
If you end up running late for the start of our trip.....no problem.
<strong>You are the only client</strong> so there's no one else worry about.
You receive 100% of our attention!  We can offer this personal service to our guests because we only do PRIVATE tours.
If you want to be herded into a van with strangers and guided by someone who is also here on vacation then this is probably not the tour for you.
I have fine tuned my tours over the years and supply everything you’ll need for your adventure which makes planning easy and stress free.
You will never be quoted a price and then expected to go buy bug repellant, sunscreen, additional gear, etc.
I supply all that as well as cold bottled water and fresh seasonal fruit for every trip.
I also supply dry bags and boxes to keep your personal belongings safe and if it happens to rain I will even have a poncho for you.
We’re truly a small family business therefore we offer family discounts to make it affordable for everyone.....because we care

I do not solicit magazines & tv productions or purchase advertisement on Tripadvisor and search engines in order to crowd your trip.
I could engage all these marketing techniques and take the "sausage factory" approach but I choose not to.
It's not good for my guests or the environment.
Actually, my goal is exactly the opposite.....that is to provide a private tour for you and only you while maintaining a low impact on the environment.
I encourage you to contact me first and arrange a Private Tour before you settle for anything less.
Let's explore the Everglades & 10,000 Islands together!
