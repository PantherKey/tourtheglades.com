    <h2 class="title"><strong>Welcome to Tour The Glades!</strong> </h2>

    <!--COPY-->
    <p>
    I'm Tod and I'll be your guide & host during your visit.
    I have <strong>ONE</strong> job year round, providing Private Guided Tours for YOU here in the Everglades and 10,000 Islands.
    I was born and raised here in SW Florida, my children go to school in Everglades City and we live here year round.  
    Nature and the Environment have been my passion since I was a child and I bring that with me on every trip.
    It was my early obsession with reptiles & amphibians that led me into the Florida wilderness.
    I first began catching snakes, lizards and turtles in the 3rd grade and bringing them to school for show & tell.
    I would constantly try to convince my friends to come with me to look for animals and explore the wilderness....now they call that Eco-Tourism.
    Florida history is also one of my passions and that seeps into my tours as well.
    I'm continuously studying the lives and culture of the Florida natives, early settlers and pioneers and I'm on the board of directors at the <a href="http://www.evergladeshistorical.org/">Everglades Society for Historical Preservation</a>.
    I focus on the Quality of my tours not the Quantity of guests.  My guests tend to be travel & tour connoisseurs.
    They have have done the group tours in the past and realize my approach is best.
    
    The <strong>Private Tour / Native Guide</strong> approach allows my guests to experience the Everglades in a very unique and intimate way.
    </p>

    My good friend and neighbor Capt Jim does the guided Motorboat Tours to the 10,000 Islands year round.  
    Jim's also a Florida Native and a Master Naturalist graduate from The University of Florida. Much of Jim's childhood was spent with his 5 brothers 
    on their 14ft aluminum boat "The Hammerhead".....exploring and battling each other for the title of Captain.  
    Those early childhood adventures eventually led to him becoming a US Coast Guard licensed Captain today. Over the past 40 years Jim has explored
    the Everglades & Southwest Florida by motorboat, jeep, kayak and on foot. Jim also collects data for Dolphin Research in neighboring Rookery Bay Preserve 
    and monitors our Sea Turtle population in the 10,000 Island National Wildlife Refuge. He respects and appreciates the area and you'll sense that from the moment 
    you meet him.  It has taken me many years to find the perfect Captain / Guide for motorboat tour, someone that I can trust that also has a passion for the environment. 
    Jim is a true steward of the Everglades & 10,000 Islands and I'm proud to have him on my team....so will you!

    UPDATE - December 20th, 2014.
    After 10 great months my co-guide Jenny informed me that she would no longer be able to do tours.
    I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused my guests with existing reservations.
    I appreciate your understanding and flexibility as I reschedule and/or re-assign your trips.
   
    I will continue to lead the guided tours as I have for the past several years now and will be offering some NEW innovative tours this season as well.
    My family and I are looking forward to a prosperous new year of adventure and exploration here in the Everglades.....come join us!
