Everglades City & Chokoloskee Island are a birder's paradise!  We are located in the "3 Corners" section of the Everglades where Everglades National Park, Fakahatcheee Strand State Preserve and Big Cypress National Preserve all meet.
If you are a serious birder and looking to build your list or searching for a specific Life Bird this is the tour for you.
My buddy Drue is a year round resident and expert birder who can deliver the hard to find species.
Drew has worked for 7 years doing bird and wildlife rehabilitation and is currently assisting the Conservancy of SW Florida on their various avian projects.
He can take you deep in the wilderness and even around town to locate your Target Species.
Pileated  Woodpecker, Roseate Spoonbill, Mangrove Cuckoo, Harrier Hawk, Loggerhead Shrike and even the Painted Bunting have all been discovered here.
We have found the best way to spot these birds is on a walking tour, motorboat or an elevated platform vehicle.
Most tours are approximately 3-4 hours and will be customized for your specific request.
All tours are Private....fresh fruit, water and all your necessities are provided (even binoculars).
Email or give us a call with the birds you are looking for and we can decide the best way to spot them.
