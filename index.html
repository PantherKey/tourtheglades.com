    <h2 class="title"><strong>Welcome to The Everglades!</strong> </h2>

    <!--COPY-->
    <p>
    Thank you for choosing Tour The Glades... the <strong>ONLY</strong> exclusively Private multi-tour operator in the Everglades! I'm Tod and I'll be your guide & host during your visit. 
    I'm a Florida Native and my family and I live here in the Everglades year round. We focus on the Quality of our tours not the Quantity of guests. You are the only client and receive 100% of our attention.
    This approach is better for the environment and hands down the best way to explore the Everglades....just you and your own Naturalist Guide.
    I have fine tuned my tours over the years and provide everything youâ€™ll need which makes planning stress free.
    We supply cold bottled water, fresh fruit, and all the necessities for every trip. We also offer professional grade Pelican Case dry boxes to keep your camera and personal belongings safe.
    You won't be expected to purchase any additional items for your trip because we offer them complimentary.

    When we have a big family or I'm booked my buddy Logan helps with the guided kayak tours. Logan earned his biology degree from Miami University with entomology as an area of concentration.  
    Logan also volunteers with US-State Department of Fisheries on their restocking programs and invasive fish management. 
    He is currently studying the Tarpon population of SW Florida, which will no doubt be a life long project. 
    Logan's a naturalist through and through and hopes to one day work as a Biologist at one of the parks here in the Everglades & 10,000 Islands. 
    He is a true steward of the Everglades and I'm proud to have him on my team....so will you.
     </p>

    We can only do one (sometimes two) trips per day which makes each one special.
    Our guests tend to be travel & tour connoisseurs that have done their research. 
    They've experienced the "cookie cutter" tours elsewhere and recognize the benefits of my approach.
    The <strong>Private Tour / Native Guide</strong>  philosophy allows my guests to experience the Everglades in a very unique and intimate way.
    Our tours will create lifelong memories. Whether you're searching for Alligator, Panther, Manatee, Dolphin, Rare Birds or just a relaxing day in Nature....we can deliver.

    Start times are flexible although morning and late afternoons are best for wildlife viewing.  
    During the Summer (June-Aug) mornings are ideal because of the chance afternoon rains.
