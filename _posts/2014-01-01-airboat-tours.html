Airboats have been a part of the Gladesmen culture here in the Everglades for many years.
You can experience this Everglades tradition with a local guide year round.
Our Airboat partner, Speedy's Airboats can take you through the mangrove forest and out to the grasslands for the ride of your life.
Airboats are more of a thrill ride although you may also see Alligators and a variety of Bird species as well.
The airboats are small and only seat 6 people. However, they an also arrange a Private Tour if you like....just ask.
