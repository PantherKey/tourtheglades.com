This combination Kayak & Small Motorboat tour of the Everglades is with out a doubt THE BEST way to experience this vast wilderness.
Kayaks are best for the calm, shallow waters and tight mangrove tunnels of the backcountry. 
A small motor boat is best for exploring the islands.
You won't want to battle winds and strong currents in a kayak especially with other motorboats sharing the waters.
We have created three unique tours designed to accommodate your personal preferences and stimulate the explorer within you. 
You'll start your day in the mangrove jungle of the Fakahatchee Strand section of the Everglades and finish in the mysterious 10,000 Islands.
All tours are PRIVATE and operated by Native Guides and year round residents.
We can accommodate any size group although 2 - 8 people are best.
We can provide group & child discounts as well, just ask. 
As with all our tours EVERYTHING will be provided.
Leave the planning to us.....all you need to do is show up with your sense of adventure.

<h2>The Day Tripper / $245 Per Person - $120 Children 17 - 7 and 6 and younger are FREE</h2>
<p>
The morning begins with a leisurely 3.5 hour kayak tour over the calm, pristine waters of the backcountry.
We'll glide beneath the canopy of the trees and out to the open ponds and grass prairies of the Everglades.
Be on the look out for Alligators, River Otter, Racoon, Osprey and a wide variety of wading birds.
Afterwards you can enjoy a casual lunch at one of the great family owned restaurants in town or maybe a picnic and some exploring on your own (we'll assist you with both).
For the next part of your journey you'll board a small, quiet motorboat for a 3 hour tour of the breathtaking 10,000 Islands.
Here you'll be on the search for Dolphin, Manatee and the American Bald Eagle!
You can even stop and explore a remote island beach if you like.

<h2>The Seasoned Voyager / $249 Per Per Person</h2>
<p>
Venture down an ancient river on your kayak through the mangrove tunnels and past the grass prairie to the beautiful 10,000 Islands.
Known as the Amazon of North America, you’ll glide under the canopy of our country’s only subtropical wilderness all the way to Fakahatchee Island.
Curious Dolphins and Manatee sometimes pop up for a visit along the way so have your camera ready.
You'll travel through the progression of changing ecosystems from freshwater to salt.
Once you make it to the mouth of the river you'll see your next destination.....the ancient "man made" island across the bay, Fakahatchee Island.
During our exploration of the island you’ll discover remanence of the ancient Calusa Indians as well as the early settlers of the 1800′s.
From the island you’ll enjoy a leisurely motorboat tour through the 10,000 Islands and back to the mainland.
This is a whole day trip...plan on 6-8 hours.

<h2>The Serious Explorer / $275 Per Person  *Picnic Lunch Included</h2>

This is only for the true adventurer because YOU will become an explorer!  You'll navigate through the dense mangrove forest of the Everglades all the way to the 10,000 Islands on your own!  You'll be given a map and all the necessary equipment and provisions will be provided for your journey.
A safety guide will follow along to make sure no one gets lost but YOU will be leading the way!  Once you make it to the mouth of the river you'll paddle across the bay to Fakahatchee Island to explore the ancient Calusa Indian Mounds and enjoy a picnic lunch.
You'll discover many native plants and some exotic varieties that are indigenous to the Yucatan.
How did they get here??  After your exploration a motorboat will retrieve the group and return to the mainland.
Count on a full day commitment with memories that will last a lifetime.
