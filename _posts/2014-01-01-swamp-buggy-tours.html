Swamp Buggies have been a part of the Gladesmen culture here in the Everglades for many years.
You can experience this Everglades tradition with a 5th generation Everglades Guide.
My buddy Shannon can take you deep into the Big Cypress National Preserve in search of Alligators, Black Bear and even Florida Panther!
You'll be seated high above the swamp which makes for great photography opportunities and move along at a slow pace through the great cypress forest to see places very few people experience.
At some point during your trip you'll be able to stop, get down and walk around.  Shannon can also take a plaster cast of any Bear & Panther prints you may discover. 
During the winter months we do an evening Campfire tour....complete with stories (some true some not) and toasted marshmallows!
