Once you set foot on the beautiful white sugar sand beaches of the 10,000 Islands you won&#8217;t want to leave.
Because of the extensive preservation efforts some of these islands look the same as they did 1,000 years ago.
We&#8217;ll travel by motorboat or kayak to Florida&#8217;s unspoiled wilderness for an overnight camping trip that you&#8217;ll remember forever.
We&#8217;ve taken all the planning and preparing out of the trip and replaced it with ease and comfort.
Your personal guide will set up &amp; breakdown camp, shop for &amp; prepare all your meals, take you exploring / beach combing and basically make sure you&#8217;re comfortable and safe during your trip.
All food, transportation and equipment is provided&#8230;even air mattresses!
