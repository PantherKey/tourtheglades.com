Once you set foot on the beautiful white sugar sand beaches of the 10,000 Islands you won&#8217;t want to leave.
Because of the extensive preservation efforts some of these islands look the same as they did 1,000 years ago.
We&#8217;ll travel by motorboat or kayak to Florida&#8217;s unspoiled wilderness for an overnight camping trip that you&#8217;ll remember forever.
We&#8217;ve taken all the planning and preparing out of the trip and replaced it with ease and comfort.
Your personal guide will set up &amp; breakdown camp, shop for &amp; prepare all your meals, take you exploring / beach combing and basically make sure you&#8217;re comfortable and safe during your trip.
All food, transportation and equipment is provided&#8230;even air mattresses!
         </p>
         <p>
If you are an experienced camper and want to do it on your own we can arrange that as well.  
We will supply all the necessary gear, motorbat transportation, local guidence and anything else you'll need for you trip. 
December through April is the best time of year to camp on the islands.
