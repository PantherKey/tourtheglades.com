Discover the natural beauty of The Big Cypress National Preserve on our combination wilderness drive and hike. By combining the two we are able to explore over 30 miles
of this diverse landscape which is our nations very first National Preserve. Big Cypress is home to a wide variety of wildlife including the endangered Everglades Mink, Whitetail Deer, 
Black Bear, a multitude of various Bird species, and even the Florida Panther!  The hiking trails are flat and easily traversed which makes for a very nice leisurely walk through nature.
Plan on a 4+ hour commitment with about 3 hours on the hiking trails, somewhere along the way we'll stop for a picnic snack.It will be just you and your guide so you can move along at your own pace.

Early morning and just before sunset are the best times to go.  A hat and sunglasses are a good idea but not mandatory, proper shoes are definitely recommended.
All tours are PRIVATE and led by <a href="http://tourtheglades.com/about-us" target="_blank">Local Guides</a>. We supply cold bottled water, fresh fruit and snack, sunscreen and insect repellent all complimentary of course.
You can leave your vehicle at our meeting point because transportation is also provided.
