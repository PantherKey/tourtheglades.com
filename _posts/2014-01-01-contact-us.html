              If you call or email you'll probably chat with my friend Lashaun.  She was born and raised here with the Everglades as her backyard.  As a matter of fact her Great Grandfather Cecil Oglesby was a Locomotive Conductor here back in the day and operated <a href="http://www.jeff-z.com/wks/locoroster/4/ltcc2.html" target="_blank">"The Deuce"</a> which is now on display at the Naples Museum.

            <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">
              Lashaun's been on the tours you're inquiring about so she knows first hand what you'll encounter. She also knows the folks at the hotels, restaurants and local business you'll be visiting and can help you with whatever you'll need. 
	Lashaun is a combination of Pepper Potts, Wonder Woman (2017 version) and all 3 Charlie's Angles wrapped up in one! You'll see she's very diligent and can make anything happen....we're lucky to have her on the team!
