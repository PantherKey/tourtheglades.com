<p>
Have you ever dreamed of becoming a certified "Master Naturalist" ? It's not as difficult as you may think.
If you have a few extra days and $200 you can receive your certificate from the prestigious University of Florida while visiting the Naples area.
Classes are offered throughout the year and are both fun and educational.
Many of our seasonal residents and extended vacationers take the course to better familiarize themselves with the area's flora and fauna.
This is more of a classroom approach but also includes a field trip! The course is not designed to create experts in botany, herpetology, or any other discipline...but upon completion you'll receive a certificate as well as a fancy patch & lapel pin!

Anyone age 18 and up is welcome to attend. Click below for a class schedule and details.
