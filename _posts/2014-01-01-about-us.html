It was my early obsession with reptiles & amphibians that led me into the Florida wilderness.
I first began catching snakes, lizards and turtles in the 3rd grade and bringing them to school for show & tell.
I would constantly try to convince my friends to come with me to look for animals and explore the wilderness....now they call that "Eco-Tourism".
Florida history is also one of my passions and that seeps into my tours as well.
I'm on the board of directors at the Everglades Society for Historic Preservation and continuously study the lives and culture of the Florida natives, early settlers and pioneers
I only do private tours because I know from experience that the less noise you make the more wildlife you’ll encounter. 
This also allows you to move along at your own pace and enhances your overall experience.
When you set out in a van with a mixed group of people it’s just not the same as going with your own personal guide.
I do my tours in the hard to reach areas that are less traveled by tourists because I find my guests enjoy
the quiet and isolation of the Everglades as well.

I do not fancy myself as a teacher and will never address you like I'm your camp counselor.
I don't try to instill fear in my guests....I choose to empower them with knowledge instead.
The Everglades is not the horrifying, scary place that Hollywood will have you believe.  It's actually a beautifully delicate environment that you must "get into" in order to truly appreciate.
If anyone attempts to convince you otherwise it's only because they do not yet understand this ecosystem and it's wildlife.
I have spent 30+ years exploring the Florida wilderness and I pass that knowledge & confidence on to my guests.

When choosing a guide (no mater where you’re visiting) you’ll want to go with a Native
Someone born and raised in the area with a true passion for what they’re doing will make the difference in your trip.
I'm here kayaking, hiking and camping in the Everglades & 10,000 Islands year round.  When I'm not taking guests out on tours I'm outdoors with my children and friends.
My job is a lifestyle...not a 1-800 business plan. I feel that's what makes my tours different from the rest.
My guests experience that first hand and write about it in their Tripadvisor reviews.  I end up becoming friends with many of my guests and they return every year for another adventure.

My good friend and neighbor Capt Jim does the guided Motorboat Tours to the 10,000 Islands year round. 
Jim's also a Florida Native and a Master Naturalist graduate from The University of Florida. Much of Jim's childhood was spent with his 5 brothers
on their 14ft aluminum boat "The Hammerhead".....exploring and battling each other for the title of Captain. 
Those early childhood adventures eventually led to him becoming a US Coast Guard licensed Captain today. Over the past 40 years Jim has explored
the Everglades & Southwest Florida by motorboat, jeep, kayak and on foot. Jim also collects data for Dolphin Research in neighboring Rookery Bay Preserve
and monitors our Sea Turtle population in the 10,000 Island National Wildlife Refuge. He respects and appreciates the area and you'll sense that from the moment
you meet him.  It has taken me many years to find the perfect Captain / Guide, someone that I can trust that also has a passion for the environment.
Jim is a true steward of the Everglades & 10,000 Islands and I'm proud to have him on my team....so will you!
