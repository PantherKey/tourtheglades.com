Explore this ancient subtropical wilderness which happens to be the orchid and bromeliad capital of the nation! Home of the coveted Ghost Orchid, the Fakahatchee Strand section of the Everglades has over 40 native orchids and 14 native bromeliad species.
The Fakahatchee is also the only place in the world where bald cypress trees and royal palms share the forest canopy.
This area is home to the endangered Everglades Mink, Whitetail Deer, Black Bear, Great Horned Owls, and even the elusive Florida Panther!
Most trails are under the canopy, groomed and easily traversed&#8230;..others are slightly more rugged, sometimes wet, and can require a bit more effort.
This diversity makes it perfect for a novice or an experienced hiker.
Plan on a 4 hour commitment with about 3+ hours in the forest.
Somewhere along the way we&#8217;ll stop for a picnic snack.
