I monitor wildlife movement throughout the year and can bring you to the right place at the right time to witness some very unique animal behaviors.
Courtship & mating, nesting & hatching for example can all be observed year round.
I've also developed a few specialty tours for my guests that I offer every once and a while.
These tours change throughout the season so check back often.

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><b>Airboat and Swamp Buggy Tours</b></span></h2>

<!------COPY------>
Airboats and Swamp Buggies have been a part of the Gladesmen culture here in the Everglades for many years.  You can experience this Everglades tradition with a local guide year round.
Our Airboat partner can take you through the mangrove forest and out to the grasslands for the ride of your life.  Airboats are more of a thrill ride although you may also see Alligators and a variety of Bird species as well.
The airboats are small and only seat 6 people. However, we can also arrange a Private Tour if you like....just ask.
Our SWAMP BUGGY Partner can take you deep into the Big Cypress National Preserve in search of Alligators, Black Bear and even Florida Panther!
You'll be seated high above the swamp which makes for great photography opportunities and move along at a slow pace through the great cypress forest to see places very few people experience.
The swamp buggies are semi-private and you can even get out and explore with your guide if you desire.  Intimate evening Campfire tours are also available....complete with toasted marshmallows!

<!------COPY------>
Spend a couple hours in the protected waters of the beautiful mangrove backcountry foraging for your food just as the Natives and Early Settlers did long ago.
You'll be led by a native guide that will take you to the far reaches of the 10,000 Islands in search of your dinner.
Spotted Trout, Snook, Refish, Drum and Snapper are all very abundant in this area.
Blue & Stone Crab can also be found and collected in season.
We have everything you'll need to catch'em and will even bait the hook for you.
In between stops you may even see dolphin, manatee and a variety of birds as well.
When you get back to the dock your guide will clean your catch and send you off to the restaurant!
You can have your catch however you like....grilled, blackened, fried....it's all included in the price!!!
