When choosing a guide (no mater where you’re visiting) you’ll want to go with a Native.
Someone born and raised in the area with a true passion for what they’re doing will make the difference in your trip.
I'm here kayaking, hiking and camping in the Everglades & 10,000 Islands year round.
When I'm not taking guests out on tours I'm outdoors with my children and friends.
My job is a lifestyle...not a 1-800 business plan. I feel that's what makes my tours different from the rest.
I do not fancy myself as a teacher and will never address you like I'm your camp counselor.
We will explore the Everglades together, as friends.

I only do private tours because I know from experience that the less noise you make the more wildlife you’ll encounter.
This also allows you to move along at your own pace and enhances your overall experience.
When you set out in a van with a mixed group of people it’s just not the same as going with your own personal guide.
I don't do mixed group tours because I know it only dilutes my guest's experience.
I do not solicit magazines & tv productions or purchase advertisement on search engines in order to crowd your trip.
I could engage in these marketing techniques but I choose not to.
It's not good for my guests or the environment.
Actually, my goal is exactly the opposite...that is to provide a private tour for you and only you.
</p>

I have fine tuned my tours over the years and supply everything you’ll need for all your Everglades Adventure Tours.
This makes planning easy and stress free.
We supply insect repellant, sunscreen, cold bottled water and fresh seasonal fruit for every trip
We also supply dry bags and boxes to keep your personal belongings safe and if it happens to rain we'll even have a poncho for you.
Just let us know if you have any special requests and we can arrange that too.
You can drive your car to our starting point so after we're done you're free to leave and continue your vacation.
If you end up running late for the start of our trip...no problem.
We can offer this personal service to our guests because you are the only client!
There's no one else worry about and you receive 100% of our attention.
That's the difference!
