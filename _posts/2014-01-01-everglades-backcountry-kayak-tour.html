See parts of this vast wilderness that are only accessible by kayak.
Glide through th<span style="font-size: small;">e delicate</span> ecosystem of the Everglades at your own pace as you explore the mangrove tunnels, grass prairies, and the hardwood hammocks of the backcountry.
Have your camera ready because alligators, osprey, otter, bald eagles, a variety of wading birds <span style="font-size: small;">and even manatee</span> call this area home.
It’s a calm, leisurely paddle that’s great for first timers and experienced paddlers alike.
Early morning and just before sunset are the best times to go.
However, all tours are Private so we can<span style="font-size: small;"> be flexible and</span> start at a time that’s most convenient for you.
A hat and sunglasses are a good idea but not mandatory.
We supply cold bottled water, fresh seasonal fruit, sunscreen, dry containers to protect your belongings and if needed…head lamps, rain ponchos &amp; bug spray all provided  complimentary.
We tell our guests to plan on a 4 hour commitment with about 3.5 on the water.
And yes we can certainly stop for a bathroom break if nature should call.

Experience the sunset or sunrise like never before! Paddle out to the grass prairies of the Everglades and watch as the sun dips into the 10,000 Islands.
Once the sky turns shades of pink and purple, the flocks of birds begin their return to the evening&#8217;s roost.
If you&#8217;re an early riser you will be rewarded as well.
You&#8217;ll begin our trip with head lamps as we make our way through the mangrove jungle, listening as the Everglades come alive.
Once the sun rises and illuminates your surroundings you will be astonished.
A full moon will accentuate either one of these adventures so check your calendar.
