    <h2 class="title"><strong>Welcome to The Everglades!</strong> </h2>

    <!--COPY-->
    <p>
    Thank you for choosing Tour The Glades! I'm Tod and I'll be your guide & host during your visit. 
    I have <strong>ONE</strong> job, providing Private Guided Tours in the Everglades and 10,000 Islands.
    I'm a Florida Native and live here in the Everglades year round.
    I have fine tuned my tours and supply everything youâ€™ll need which makes planning stress free.
    We supply cold bottled water, fresh seasonal fruit, sunscreen and insect repellent (if needed) for every trip.
    We also provide professional grade dry boxes to keep your camera and personal belongings safe.  
    I've built the company's reputation up over the years by focusing on the Quality of our tours not the Quantity of guests.
    We're not concerned with anyone else, you are the only client and receive 100% of our attention....I've found that works best for everyone.
    
    </p>
    <p>
    I focus primarily on the Kayak, Hiking and Camping trips. My good friend and neighbor Capt Jim does the guided Motorboat Tours to the 10,000 Islands year round.
    Jim's also a Florida Native and a Master Naturalist graduate from The University of Florida. Over the past 40 years Jim has explored the Everglades & Southwest Florida by motorboat, jeep, kayak and on foot.
    Jim also collects data for Dolphin Research in neighboring Rookery Bay Preserve and monitors our Sea Turtle population in the 10,000 Island National Wildlife Refuge.
    He respects and appreciates the area and you'll sense that from the moment you meet him. It has taken me many years to find the perfect Captain / Guide, someone that I can trust that 
    also has a passion for the environment. Jim is a true steward of the Everglades & 10,000 Islands and I'm proud to have him on my team....so will you!
    

    </p>
    <p>
    We can only do one (sometimes two) trips per day which makes each one special.
    Our guests tend to be travel & tour connoisseurs that have done their research. 
    They've experienced the "cookie cutter" tours elsewhere and recognize the benefits of my approach.
    The <strong>Private Tour / Native Guide</strong> philosophy allows my guests to experience the Everglades in a very unique and intimate way.
    Our tours will create lifelong memories.  Take a look at what we offer and decide what works best for you. 
    Whether you're searching for Alligator, Panther, Manatee, Dolphin, Rare Birds or just a relaxing day in Nature....we can deliver.
    Start times are flexible although morning and late afternoons are best for wildlife viewing.
    If we are booked I will set you up with one of my fellow guides here that can assist you.  I have a buddy that does Kayak & Motorboat Tours, Airboat & Swamp Buggie Rides...I even have a buddy that will take you out Fishing for the day!

     If you have any questions just send me an email or call and together we can come up with a plan.
    </p>
