Discover the natural beauty of The Big Cypress National Preserve on our combination Wilderness Drive and Hiking Tour. By combining the two we are able to explore over 30 miles
of this diverse ecosystem which is our nation's very first National Preserve. Big Cypress is home to a wide variety of wildlife including the American Alligator, Everglades Mink, Whitetail Deer, 
 Black Bear, a multitude of various Bird species, and even the endangered Florida Panther!  The hiking trails are flat and easily traversed which makes for a very nice leisurely walk through nature.
Plan on a 4+ hour commitment with about 3 hours on the hiking trails, somewhere along the way we'll stop for a picnic snack. It will be just you and your guide so you can move along at your own pace.

Start times are fexible, however early morning and just before sunset are the best for observing wildlife.  A hat and sunglasses are a good idea but not mandatory, proper shoes are definitely recommended.
All tours are PRIVATE and led by <a href="http://tourtheglades.com/about-us" target="_blank">Local Resident Guides</a>. We supply cold bottled water, fresh fruit and snack, sunscreen and insect repellent all complimentary of course.
You can leave your vehicle at our meeting point because transportation is also provided.

Are you up for a more relaxing day touring the Everglades and viewing our Native Wildlife?  Then our Private Driving Tour is perfect for you!  You can sit back and let us do the driving, and if you're staying in Everglades City or Port Of The Islands we'll even pick you up at your hotel!  
From there we tour the historic sites in Everglades City & Chokoloskee Island including the Ted Smallwood Trading Post & Historic Rod & Gun Club.  You'll learn the history of the area and meet some colorful local characters along the way.   
From there we travel deep into the Big Cypress National Preserve for wildlife viewing along the Legendary Loop Road.  Along the way we can also stop at other  points of interest like Clyde Butcher's Gallery, The Skunk Ape Research Center or The Kirby Storter Boardwalk.  
At some point during our adventure we'll stop for lunch at the Miccosukee Indian Restaurant which is on the actual Reservation or Joanie's Blue Crab Cafe!
